Just for learning purposes: 

AI Burnout Detector: a web app where you log in with your Google account, it reads your last 2 weeks of calendar events, and an AI analyzes the patterns (back-to-back meetings, late nights, no breaks, weekend work) to give you a burnout risk score and personalized recommendations like "you had 47 hours of meetings last week: try blocking Friday afternoons"
